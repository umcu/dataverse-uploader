This repository contains scripts for
1. uploading to a Dataverse server
2. cloning a Dataverse setup (sub-dataverses, groups and roles) to another Dataverse server
3. gathering statistics about file types and sizes
4. converting a statistics file (SPSS or SAS) to a ZIP file that contains the data in CSV form, plus a codebook

It uses a simple interface class that uses the Dataverse native API.
